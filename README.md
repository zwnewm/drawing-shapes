Debug Notes:

1. Program had the turtle draw a line while moving to the next shape.
   I fixed it by picking up the turtle, moving it, then putting it back down.

2. My program did not compile and it showed an error early on when coding.
   I fixed it by ensuring that the for-loop was properly indented, and then it ran as intended.
